MUST READ

In the next lecture, we set up the course project.

Make sure, you do create that app by also adding the --no-strict flag to the ng new command - otherwise you will run into issues later on (we'll still dive into that "Strict Mode" later in the course of course, no worries)!

We'll also install the Bootstrap CSS Framework and in this course, we use version 3 of the framework. Install it via npm install --save bootstrap@3  => The @3  is important!

Additionally, when using a project created with Angular CLI 6+ (check via ng v ), you'll have an angular.json  file instead of an .angular-cli.json  file. In that file, you still need to add Bootstrap to the styles[]  array as shown in the next video, but the path should be node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css , NOT ../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css . The leading ../  must not be included.

Also see this lecture - I do show the complete setup process there: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/t/lecture/6655614/

If you're facing any problems, please have a look at this very thorough thread by Jost: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/17862130#questions/10444944


Alternative Non-Collapsable Navigation Bar
The way we added it, the Navbar will collapse on smaller screens. Since we didn't implement a Hamburger menu, that means that there's no way of accessing our links on smaller screens.

You can either add such a menu on your own (see below), or you replace collapse navbar-collapse  with just navbar-default.

Adding a Hamburger Menu:

Alternatively, if you want to make the navigation bar responsive, please replace these lines in header.component.html:

<div class="navbar-header">
  <a routerLink="/" class="navbar-brand">Recipe Book</a>
</div>
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
with these lines:

<div class="navbar-header">
  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" (click)="collapsed = !collapsed">
	<span class="icon-bar" *ngFor="let iconBar of [1, 2, 3]"></span>
  </button>
  <a routerLink="/" class="navbar-brand">Recipe Book</a>
</div>
<div class="navbar-collapse" [class.collapse]="collapsed" (window:resize)="collapsed = true">
and add this line to header.component.ts:

collapsed = true;
